Jami3ti also addresses the need for better understanding the demands for Higher Education of the displaced Syrian youth in Jordan."

msgid "about_text2"
msgstr "As the only United Nations agency with a mandate in Higher Education, UNESCO’s contribution through this website is to facilitate the development of evidence-based policy responses to the educational needs of the displaced Syrian Youth and also vulnerable Jordanian peers impacted by the refugee crisis."

msgid "about_text3"
msgstr "Jordan continues to receive refugees as a result of the protracted civil conflict that erupted in Syria in March 2011. UNHCR statistics on refugees that are eligible for higher education present only aggregated figures; not enough to facilitate the provision of university education opportunities matching their schooling profiles and targeted needs. There also seems to be a real information gap with regard to matching potential beneficiaries of higher education services to available options for them to start or resume their studies. In addition to the lack of access to information on existing opportunities in their host countries or abroad, some refugees may be facing financial, administrative, and geographical accessibility barriers inside the host country that prevent the majority from resuming their university education. In a humanitarian environment, donor resource allocations face competing priorities between life-saving, relief or resilience concerns. Donors are increasingly searching for hard evidence on the real nature and scope of the demand, as well as, concrete cost-effective opportunities before financing higher education programmes for displaced refugees."
